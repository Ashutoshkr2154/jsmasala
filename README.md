## üöÄ How to Run Locally

You will need two terminals running at the same time.

### 1. Backend Server

First, start the backend server.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd jsm-masala-backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in this folder and add your secret keys (MongoDB URI, JWT secrets, Cloudinary keys, etc.).
4.  Run the server (using nodemon for auto-reload):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *Server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.*

### 2. Frontend App

1.  Open a **new terminal**.
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd jsm-masala-frontend
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in this folder and point it to your local backend:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
5.  Run the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *App will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.*

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on free-tier services:

* **Backend (Render):** Deployed as a "Web Service".
* **Frontend (Vercel):** Deployed as a "Vite" project.
* **Database (MongoDB Atlas):** Deployed as a "Free M0 Cluster".

The frontend's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable must be updated on Vercel to point to the live Render backend URL.
